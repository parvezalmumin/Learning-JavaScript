 How it works:
              1-var i = 1; → Start with 1

              2-while (i <= 5) → Keep running the block as long as i is 5 or less

              3-Inside the loop:

                                 3.1-Print the value

                                3.2-Increase i by 1

             4-When i becomes 6, the loop stops
