#  What is an Infinite Loop?
   - An infinite loop is a loop that never stops running because its condition never becomes false.

# Example: Infinite while loop
___________________________________________________________
|                                                          |
| while (true) {                                           |
|  console.log("I will never stop!");                      |
|  }                                                       |

This code keeps printing "I will never stop!" forever, because the condition true is always true.


Example: Infinite for loop (by mistake)
________________________________________________________________
|                                                               |
| for (var i = 1; i >= 0; i++) {                                |
| console.log("Oops");                                          |
| }                                                             |

Here, i is increasing.
But the condition is i >= 0, which is always true for positive numbers.
So it never ends.

# How to avoid infinite loops
-Always make sure the condition will become false eventually.
-Update the counter properly.
-Test with small loops first.


# Warning:
-Running an infinite loop in the browser or online editors can crash or freeze your browser.
-Use console.log() carefully, and donâ€™t run infinite loops unless you know how to stop them.
