# What is happening here?
                          -This is a for...of loop used on a string (strVar).
                        -In JavaScript, strings are iterable, which means you can loop through each character in the string.
    

# Breakdown:
        strVar: A string variable like "Parvez"

        val: A temporary variable that will hold each character one by one
