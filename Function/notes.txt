# What is a Function?
A function is like a reusable machine in your code.
       You give it some input (data), it processes that, and then gives you an output (result).

Think of it like a coffee machine:
               Input: Coffee powder + water
               Machine: Coffee maker
               Output: Coffee

# Why use Functions?
                    - Avoid repeating the same code again and again.
                    - Keep code clean and organized.
                    - Make your program easier to debug and update.
