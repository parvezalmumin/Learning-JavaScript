 #Defination - JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that allows you to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs in the browser, alongside HTML and CSS.

         -Think of HTML as the structure (skeleton), CSS as the style (clothes), and JavaScript as the behavior (movements and brain) of a webpage.


#Why Use JavaScript?
    =JavaScript adds life to a website. You can use it to:

                  -Show popups, alerts, or sliders

                  -Make forms interactive (like checking input)

                  -Build games and apps

                  -Communicate with servers (APIs)

                  -Modify HTML and CSS without reloading the page
