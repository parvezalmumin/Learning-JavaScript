 #What Are Increment and Decrement?
     -These are unary operators (they work on a single variable) used to increase or decrease a number by 1.

âœ… Increment (++)
Adds 1 to the value.

âœ… Decrement (--)
Subtracts 1 from the value.



ðŸ”„ Two Types:
There are two ways to use these operators:

1. Postfix: x++ or x--
The value is used first, then changed.

2. Prefix: ++x or --x
The value is changed first, then used.
